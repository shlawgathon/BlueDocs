# Track 3 Deep Dive: Ocean Infrastructure & Governance Systems

> **Goal:** Reduce permitting, coordination, and deployment friction within the blue economy.

---

## Why This Track Is a Sweet Spot

| Factor | Why It Favors You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Less competition** | Most hackathon teams gravitate toward climate/cleanup — governance is "boring" but judges know it matters |
| **VC-friendly** | Reece literally said he hasn't funded MRV plays because they're "a tiny slice of a small pie." Infrastructure/governance is a *horizontal platform* play — it touches every ocean industry |
| **Real pain, right now** | Offshore wind permitting was frozen in 2025, aquaculture has fragmented multi-agency approval, and Marine Spatial Planning has no unified tooling |
| **Your stack transfers** | React + Mapbox + FastAPI + ML → perfect for a spatial coordination dashboard |

## The Core Problem (from research)

The blue economy needs **$1.5 trillion in investment by 2030** (WEF), but deployment is bottlenecked by:

1. **Fragmented permitting** — Offshore wind, OAE, aquaculture, and subsea cables each require approvals from 5-15 overlapping agencies (NOAA, EPA, Army Corps, state coastal commissions, etc.)
2. **No shared spatial awareness** — Operators don't know what else is permitted/planned in their area until conflicts arise
3. **Manual, opaque workflows** — NEPA reviews take 4+ years on average; project developers lose ~$50M/week during construction halts
4. **Zero coordination tooling** — Unlike air traffic (FAA NextGen) or land use (county GIS portals), there's no "ocean project registry" operators can query

## Three Concrete Hackathon Ideas

### 💡 Idea A: **"OceanPermit" — AI Permitting Navigator**

An AI copilot that tells ocean project developers exactly which permits they need, from which agencies, in what order, and auto-generates draft applications.

- **Input:** Project type (OAE, offshore wind, aquaculture, cable), GPS location, project parameters
- **AI:** RAG pipeline over federal/state regulatory databases → generates a custom permitting roadmap + draft documents
- **Output:** Step-by-step permit checklist, estimated timelines, auto-filled application forms
- **Demo:** User drops a pin on the map for "offshore wind farm, 20mi off MA coast" → gets a full permitting playbook in 30 seconds
- **Stack:** FastAPI + LLM (GPT-4/Claude) + Mapbox + vector DB for regulations
- **Why judges love it:** Directly solves the NEPA/permitting bottleneck that's killing offshore wind right now

---

### 💡 Idea B: **"BlueRegistry" — Ocean Project Coordination Platform**

A spatial coordination layer where all ocean projects (permitted, planned, active) are visible on one map — like a "flight radar" for the ocean economy.

- **Input:** Public permit data (BOEM, NOAA, Army Corps), AIS data, Marine Protected Area boundaries
- **AI:** Conflict detection engine — flags when a new project overlaps with existing permits, shipping lanes, MPAs, or ecological corridors
- **Output:** Interactive Mapbox dashboard showing all ocean activity layers + conflict alerts
- **Demo:** Show a map with offshore wind leases, aquaculture farms, shipping lanes, and MPAs all overlaid. Drop a new project → instant conflict analysis
- **Stack:** FastAPI + Mapbox GL + PostGIS + rule-based + ML conflict scoring
- **Why judges love it:** Visual, tangible, and solves a coordination gap that literally doesn't have a solution today

---

### 💡 Idea C: **"ReefGate" — Marine Spatial Planning Decision Engine**

AI-powered Marine Spatial Planning tool that optimizes *where* ocean projects should go based on ecological, economic, and regulatory constraints.

- **Input:** Bathymetry, ocean currents, biodiversity indices, existing infrastructure, regulatory zones
- **AI:** Multi-objective optimization (economic value vs. ecological impact vs. regulatory complexity) to rank candidate sites
- **Output:** Heatmap of optimal deployment zones for a given project type + rationale report
- **Demo:** "Where should I put a new aquaculture farm on the East Coast?" → ranked candidate zones with trade-off analysis
- **Stack:** FastAPI + XGBoost/optimization + Mapbox + SHAP explainability
- **Why judges love it:** Proactive (prevents conflicts before they happen) + reuses your ML skills from Equilibrium

## My Recommendation: **Idea B ("BlueRegistry")**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why B over A or C?**
> - **A** (Permitting Navigator) is powerful but risky for a hackathon — the regulatory corpus is massive and LLM hallucinations on legal/permit advice would hurt credibility with judges
> - **C** (MSP Decision Engine) is technically impressive but abstract — hard to demo something visceral in a day
> - **B** (BlueRegistry) hits the sweet spot: **visually stunning demo** (Mapbox with layers), **immediately understandable** ("flight radar for the ocean"), **technically achievable in a hackathon**, and **directly addresses the track's stated goal** of reducing coordination friction

You already have 80% of the stack built from Equilibrium. The pivot is mostly about *what data you show on the map* rather than rebuilding infrastructure.

## Feasibility Check (Hackathon Timeline)

| Component | Effort | Reuse from Equilibrium? |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| FastAPI backend | 2 hrs | ✅ Yes — same framework |
| Mapbox multi-layer dashboard | 3 hrs | ✅ Partial — need new layer types |
| Public data ingestion (BOEM, NOAA permits) | 2 hrs | 🔶 New — but APIs are well-documented |
| AI conflict detection engine | 3 hrs | ✅ Partial — similar to anomaly detection |
| Polish + demo prep | 2 hrs | — |
| **Total** | **~12 hrs** | |

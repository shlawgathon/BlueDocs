BlueDocs is a continuous regulatory intelligence platform for global fisheries.
It monitors updates from Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) and detects meaningful policy changes.
We convert fragmented, complex documents into structured, easy-to-understand summaries.
Each update is mapped directly to a manager’s fleet and operating regions.
Managers receive clear alerts explaining what changed and what action is required.
BlueDocs reduces compliance risk and turns regulatory complexity into actionable decisions.
